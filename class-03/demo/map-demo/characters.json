    "description": "Harry James Potter was born on 31 July 1980, at Godric's Hollow in the West Country, England, only hours after his classmate-to-be Neville Longbottom. Around this time, a prophecy regarding a boy born at the end of July with the power to defeat Voldemort was stated to wizards. Harry's christening was quiet and quick, with only mother, father, and Sirius Black in attendance. Harry spent his infancy in hiding with his parents in the Potter cottage.",

    "description": "Upon turning eleven, Hermione was happily surprised to learn that she was a witch and was therefore invited to attend Hogwarts. She eagerly accepted and took to studying magic even before she began her first year at Hogwarts in the September of 1991, learning all the set spellbooks by heart and even managing to perform a few spells successfully. In addition to the texts set by the school, Hermione brought with her several other books for reference and to further her understanding of the wizarding world,[3] to the point that she had looked at books and had more knowledge of the wizarding world than some of her pure-blood/half-blood classmates.",

    "description": "The arrival of an acceptance letter for Dean from Hogwarts caused Mrs Thomas to suspect that Dean's biological father may have been a wizard. Her suspicions were correct, he was in fact a wizard. However, she never had proof of this and so Dean was believed to be Muggle-born.[2] Dean started his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September, 1991. He was in the same year as the famous Harry Potter. During the Welcoming Feast he was Sorted into Gryffindor House, where he met with fellow Gryffindor classmate Seamus Finnigan.",
