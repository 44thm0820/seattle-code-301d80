## How to schedule your day
- 1:00pm-2:00pm code challenge
- 2:00pm-6:00pm lab
- 6:00pm-7:00pm dinner
- 7:00pm-9:00pm retro and reading
- breaks as needed, can take a longer dinner if you have familiy etc and want to work later

## Map
- use when you want to return an array of modified values

## Pasing a function as props
**Why** 
  - at times the child component needs to interact with information in the parent component
  - at times the child component needs a way to update state in the parent component
**What** 
  - the parent component sends a function into the child component on the props that will allow the child component to interact with information in the parent component by invoking that function.
