# Lecture Notes

## City Explorer
### what?
- City Explorer accepts a city name, draws a map, and then lists out some interesting data about the city, pulled from a remote data source (client + server!).
- Today we will use sample.json for dummy data
- build out the framework of the application

- we will do conditional rendering!
- work in a ternary

- recap how react works with all we have learned this week AND prep us for understanding the PD of next week lab module
